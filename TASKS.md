A workshop by [Eirik V√•geskar](https://github.com/vages), with the help of [Johannes Moskvil](https://github.com/johannbm), [Brede Kristensen](https://github.com/BredeYabo/), [Marcus Goplen](https://github.com/Goplen/), [Arve Seljebu](https://github.com/arve0/) and more colleagues at [Knowit Objectnet](https://www.knowit.no/kontakt/selskap/knowit-objectnet-as/).

## Intro: We are going to make the game Snake in Svelte

![A quadratic checkered board containing a green snake and a red apple. Above the board, you can see that the score is 0.][gameplay-png]

### Svelte

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is a language that you use to write single web pages.
You can also use it to write components that you place in existing web pages (even if the page is written in a different language than Svelte).

The blogpost [<q>Introducing Svelte, and Comparing Svelte with React and Vue</q> by Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/introducing-svelte-comparing-with-react-vue) gives a thorough introduction to Svelte and how it compares to React and Vue (TL;DR: smaller files, better developer experience).

#### SvelteKit

SvelteKit turns projects with many files written in Svelte into <q>high-performance web apps</q>, to quote [the <q>What is SvelteKit?</q> section in the SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction#what-is-sveltekit).
If you have some experience with web development (no worries if you don't) SvelteKit is to Svelte as Next.js is to React and Nuxt.js is to Vue.

> Building an app with all the modern best practices is fiendishly complicated.
> Those practices include [build optimizations](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#build-optimizations), so that you load only the minimal required code; [offline support](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/service-workers); [prefetching](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/link-options#data-sveltekit-prefetch) pages before the user initiates navigation; and [configurable rendering](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options) that allows you to render your app [on the server](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/appendix#ssr) or [in the browser](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/appendix#csr) at runtime or at [build-time](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#prerender).
> SvelteKit does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.
>
> &ndash; [The <q>What is SvelteKit?</q> section in the SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction#what-is-sveltekit)

This workshop emphasizes learning Svelte.
You will also pick up the basics of SvelteKit along the way.

In our experience, both Svelte and SvelteKit have a tendency of getting out of the way once you get the hang of them.
Perhaps you'll agree with us that using Svelte and SvelteKit feels more removing obstacles from existing web technologies rather than adding to them.

##### Tools like SvelteKit make both users and developers happy

If you are new to web development, you may wonder why tools like SvelteKit and the other mentioned technologies are needed.
The short answer is <em>to keep costs down</em>.

Writing a classic static _website_ can be as simple as creating an HTML-file for each page and uploading them to a server.
A _web app_ (short for web _application_) is a collection of _interactive_ (as opposed to static) web pages. In a web _application_, the pages may look different depending on what data is stored on the server and the actions that the user has taken at that point in time.
For example, a page may look different based on:

- what the user has done on previous pages
- whether the user has logged in
- the high scores that other users have submitted (yes, that _was_ foreshadowing)

Writing a _web application_ is harder than writing a _website_:
Pages can not be saved as static files; they have to be created on the fly.
Viewing a page requires the server and user's device to perform additional work to generate the changed page.

Generating the page and downloading it has <em>literal</em> costs attached to it:

- The server and the user's device and spend electrical power calculating the new page.
  **Power is money.**
- The server owners pays for the data it sends out.
  Most people use a phone to browse the web, often with a limited mobile data plan.
  **Data is money.**
- The user spends his or her time waiting for the page.
  Users have a tendency to leave slow applications, generating less income for the web application's creator.
  **Money is money.**

Web developers can take actions to reduce these costs.
Doing so takes a lot of time, though.
**Time is money.**

### You need the following on your computer

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A text editor, preferably [one where you can add Svelte support](https://sveltesociety.dev/tools#editor-support).
- A clone of [Vages/svelte-snake-workshop](https://github.com/Vages/svelte-snake-workshop)

If you need help installing, check out [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

### How this workshop tends to go

The repo [Vages/svelte-snake-workshop](https://github.com/Vages/svelte-snake-workshop) contains everything you need.
You can set the pace yourself.
It is possible to complete the workshop on your own.

When we hold the workshop physically or digitally, the instructors go through tasks and questions at irregular intervals.
You can ask for help from the instructors whenever you want.

We have made nearly all styling beforehand, so that you can spend the maximum amount of time coding.

#### Every task has its own sub-folder

We have divided the workshop into 6 parts, each containing several tasks.
Every task starts with a task text, sometimes followed by hints.
You can avoid or delay reading the hints if you want to challenge yourself.

Every task has a corresponding folder: `src/routes/tasks/X.Y`, `X` being the current part and `Y` the current task within that part.
For example, the folder `src/routes/tasks/2.1` contains the first task of part two.

Each task folder contains two sub-folders: `problem` and `solution`.
The `problem` folder contains the unfinished code.
The `solution` folder contains the task solution.

##### Navigate to a folder's `+page.svelte` file to start a task

SvelteKit turns a file within `src/routes` and its subfolders into a web page if and only if that file is named `+page.svelte`.
Files that start with characters _other_ than `+` (for example `my-functions.js` and `MyComponent.svelte`) are used to store reusable functions and components that we build our web page with.
SvelteKit will import things from such files if a `+page.svelte` file tells it to, but will <em>not</em> turn them into web pages.

What you type into your web browser to see the result of a `+page.svelte`-file depends on the names of the sub-folders that follow `src/routes` before finding the file.
Some examples:

| File location                               | URL in local development                | URL when deployed                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/routes/+page.svelte`                   | http://localhost:5173                   | https://svelte-snake-workshop.vercel.app                   |
| `src/routes/finished-game/+page.svelte`     | http://localhost:5173/finished-game     | https://svelte-snake-workshop.vercel.app/finished-game     |
| `src/routes/tasks/1.1/problem/+page.svelte` | http://localhost:5173/tasks/1.1/problem | https://svelte-snake-workshop.vercel.app/tasks/1.1/problem |

If you want to know more about how filenames are converted to routes, check out [the Svelte kit documentation on routing](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing).

###### Aside: SvelteKit treats some other files that start with `+` differently

SvelteKit treats _some_ files differently if their names start with a `+`, for example:

- Files named [`+layout.svelte`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#layout-layout-svelte) apply a layout to the `+page.svelte` files in its containing folder and its sub-folders.
  - The file `src/routes/+layout.svelte` adds a footer and document title to all pages in this project, as well as headers to the task pages.
- Files named [`+server.js` file](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server) are turned into resources that you can interact with using HTTP.
  - The file `src/routes/api/scores/+server.js` creates a simple high score database with an API.
- Files named [`+page.js`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page-page-js) are used to set rendering options for and fetch data to render a `+page.svelte` file.
  - The file `src/routes/+page.js` tells SvelteKit to [_prerender_](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#prerender) the front page.

You do not have to write such files yourself in this workshop.

## Part 1: Simple graphics

When you have finished this part, the game should show where the snake and the apple are on the board.

### Tutorial: What a Svelte file looks like

Svelte is a fusion of HTML, CSS and Javascript with some improvements.
In Svelte, you can write these three languages in the same file.
The parts are called ‚Äúscript‚Äù, ‚Äútemplate‚Äù and ‚Äústyling‚Äù.

```svelte
<!-- script -->
<script>
	let answer = 42;
	let color = "red";
</script>

<!-- template -->
<div style="color: {color}">
	Hello world, the answer is {answer}
</div>

<!-- styling -->
<style>
	div {
		font-weight: bold;
	}
</style>
```

Note: You can run the previous example and most examples in this document by pasting the source code into the [Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl).
You can save them for later and share them with anyone using a URL, like this: <https://svelte.dev/repl/268a89ee9c4c444ebc04025925f37c38>

You use curly brackets inside _template_ to insert variables, calculations and function calls.

```svelte
<script>
	let a = 42;
</script>

<div>The meaning of life is {a}.</div>
<div>The square of the meaning is {a * a}</div>
<div>The meaning of life has the sign {Math.sign(a)}</div>
```

Solve [the task from the Svelte tutorial about adding data](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/adding-data) before you continue.

### Task 1.1: Place the apple

Open the file `src/routes/tasks/1.1/problem/+page.svelte`.

The board contains a `<div class="apple" />`.
The variable `apple` contains a coordinate.
Your task is to place the apple on the square given by the coordinate.

The board's X axis points rightwards, and the Y axis downwards.
The constant `CELL_SIZE` stores the side length of every square.

![X axis pointing rightwards, Y axis pointing downwards][axes-png]

When you are finished, things should like this:

![The apple somewhere near the middle of the board][apple-near-middle-of-board-png]

#### Hint: The style attribute

To override and add styling to elements in HTML (not just Svelte), use the attribute `style`.
The attribute takes CSS statements.

```svelte
<div style="font-weight: bold;">Bold text</div>
```

#### Hint: left and top in CSS

Use the `left` and `top` CSS properties to move an HTML element along the `x` and `y` axes respectively.

```svelte
<div style="top: 20px; left: 10px;">Moved</div>
```

#### Hint: To reveal almost everything

To place the apple, you need to do something like this:

```svelte
<div class="apple" style="left: {calculation1}px; top: {calculation2}px;" />
```

You need to use `apple.x` and `apple.y` and `CELL_SIZE` to get these calculations to work.

### Tutorial: each blocks

The next task will require an each block.

Solve this task from the Svelte tutorial about [how each blocks work](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/each-blocks).

### Task 1.2: Draw the snake on the screen

Your task is to draw the snake on the board.

The snake is a collection of coordinates stored in the variable `snake`.
The first element in the collection is the head.
Draw each coordinate in the collection as a `<div class="body-part" />`.

The snake should look like this when you are done:

![Apple and snake correctly positioned on the board][task-1-2-end-png]

### Task 1.3: Extract the position calculation as a function

We use the calculation (`left: {foo.x * CELL_SIZE}px; top: {foo.y * CELL_SIZE}px`) multiple times in the code.
The code will be easier to maintain if we put this calculation in one place.

Your task is to move the calculation to a function, `calculatePositionAsStyle(coordinate)`, and replace all instances of the calculation with a call to this function.
The function should take a coordinate as its only argument and return a string with values for top and left.

## Part 2: Game controls

When you have finished this part, it should be possible to control the snake with the arrow keys.

### Tutorial: Listening for input

Solve the following tasks from the Svelte tutorial before you go on:

- [Listening for DOM events on an element](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/dom-events)
- [Listening for DOM events on the window](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte-window)

### Task 2.1: Listen for keyboard input

Your task is to listen for keyboard input and send it to the function `console.log`.
The application should be able to ‚Äúhear‚Äù keyboard input no matter which page is currently in focus, so that the user doesn‚Äôt have to click on a specific element on the page to play the game.

Avoid listening to keyboard input from the entire window (`svelte:window` refers to the window in its entirety).
Instead, add a listener to the Svelte specific element that refers to `document.body`.

#### Hint: Keydown event

The event to listen for is called `keydown`.You listen for it in Svelte using `on:keydown`.

#### Hint: svelte:body

You listen to `document.body` using the element `<svelte:body />`.
You listen to events on it just like with any HTML-element.

### Tutorial: Changing variable values

You will have to know how to change variable values in the next section.
Solve the following tasks from the Svelte tutorial before you go on:

- [Updating regular variables](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-assignments)
- [Updating arrays and objects](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/updating-arrays-and-objects)

### Tutorial: Importing from files in `src/lib` using `$lib`

In the next task, you will be asked to import from a file located in `src/lib` using `$lib`.
To quote [the SvelteKit documentation on `$lib`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$lib):

> ##### $lib
>
> This is a simple alias to `src/lib`, or whatever directory is specified as `config.kit.files.lib`.
> It allows you to access common components and utility modules without `../../../../` nonsense.

You can import from files found in `src/lib` using the alias, like this:

```javascript
// Importing a Javascript function from the file src/lib/bar.js
import { foo } from "$lib/bar.js";
// Importing a Svelte component from the file src/lib/Baz.svelte
import Qux from "$lib/Qux.svelte";
```

### Task 2.2: Move the snake one step in the direction of a key press

Your task is to translate key presses to movement.
The snake should move one step in the given direction every time the user presses an arrow key.
Avoid moving the snake when the user presses keys other than the arrow keys.

To make this simpler, we have made a function `convertKeyboardKeyToDirection`, found in `src/lib/game-helpers.js`, which translates key names to directions.
We use the cardinal directions to describe the directions on the board: West is left, north is up.

`+page.svelte` already imports a function from `$lib/game-helpers.js`.
To use `convertKeyboardKeyToDirection`, add the function to the functions listed in the existing `import { ‚Ä¶ } from "$lib/game-helpers.js"` statement.
Many of the functions in `game-helpers.js` are useful to this as well later tasks.
You will save time if you take a moment to make yourself familiar with the file's contents.

For now, the snake should also move if it hits itself or a wall.
We will implement game over in a later task.

#### Hint: Important Array functions

- The simplest way to add elements to the start or end of an array is to use _spreading_: `[a, ...b]`.
  (Svelte does not react to push and pop; we will come back to this later.)
- The function [Array.prototype.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) is useful when you want to remove elements from the start and end of an array.

#### Hint: Helpful utilities in `$lib/game-helpers.js`

In `$lib/game-helpers.js` you will find:

- `add(coordinateA, coordinateB)`, to add two vectors/coordinates.
- `DIRECTION_TO_VECTOR`, to go from cardinal direction to direction vector.

Add the items `DIRECTION_TO_VECTOR, add, ` to the imported items in the `import { ‚Ä¶ } from "$lib/game-helpers.js"` statement at the top of `<script>` block to use them.

## Part 3: Logic

When you have finished this part, the player should be awarded points when the snake eats an apple.
The game should stop if the snake enters an illegal position.
And the game clock should tick, so that the snake moves at regular intervals, instead of when the player presses the keys.

### Tutorial: The dollar sign in Svelte ‚Äì reactive expressions.

In spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel, you can write formulas in the cells, for example `=A1*B3`.
This places the calculation result in the cell, and the result is automatically updated when you change the contents of some cell that the calculation depends on.
This is not the way things usually are in programming: You cannot say `a = 2; b = a * 2; a = 8` and expect `b` to be 16 instead of 4 because 8 doubled is 16.
But you can make it this way in Svelte.

In Svelte we can make the computer re-run a statement as a reaction to changes.
This is done by putting a dollar sign in front of the statement.
Statements that start with a dollar sign are called _reactive statements_, because the statement is re-run as a reaction to something else.

If the statement contains a variable assignment, Svelte can keep the value updated for us.

```svelte
<script>
	let b = 3;
	let c = 4;

	$: a = (b * c) / 2; // a === 6
	b = 6;
</script>

<div>
	<!-- 
		Without `$: ‚Ä¶`, a would have the value 6, 
		but is automatically given the value 12 after 
		b is given a new value.
	-->
	The triangle's base is {b}, its height is {c} and its area is {a}.
</div>
```

Solve [the task about reactive statements from the Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/reactive-statements) before you go on.

Almost any statement can come after the dollar sign, not just assignments.
You can also write function calls and if-sentences:

```svelte
<script>
	let lastUserInput = "";
	$: if (lastUserInput === "hello") {
		// Open the console to see this message
		console.log("hello to you too");
	}
</script>

<label>Write something: <input bind:value={lastUserInput} /></label>
```

```svelte
<script>
	let lastUserInput = "";
	// What the user said, as repeated by a parrot
	$: parrotOutput = parrot(lastUserInput);

	function parrot(something) {
		return something + ", sqawk!";
	}
</script>

<label>Say something: <input bind:value={lastUserInput} /></label>
<div>
	The parrot says: {parrotOutput}
</div>
```

A reactive statement is run once when the app starts.
Svelte runs it again every time a variable used inside the statement is given a new value.
Svelte automatically notices which values a reactive statement depends on.
You do not have to state this yourself, like with for example `React.useEffect`.

Note: Svelte only notices changes that result from using the assignment operator, `=` (for example `foo.bar = "baz"`), and not those caused by method calls (such as `.push` and `.pop`).
See [the task about updating arrays and objects](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/updating-arrays-and-objects) for a more detailed explanation.

When you write game logic, you can often translate rules almost directly to reactive statements.
‚ÄúIf `x === foo`, then do a, b and c‚Äù becomes `$: if (x === foo) { a(); b(); c(); }`.

### Task 3.1: Award points when the snake eats the apple

Your task is to write a reactive statement with an if-sentence so that when the snake head is on the same coordinate as the apple, the score increases by 1.

Create a variable `score`.
This is the number of apples the snake has eaten.

When you have the score increase working, make sure that the apple is given a new random position on the board as soon as the snake eats it.

Note: You will save a lot of work in this task by using helper functions from `game-helpers.js`.

#### Hint: Help in game-helpers.js

In `game-helpers.js` you will find the function `isEqual` which says whether two coordinates are the same, and the function `pickRandomOpenSpace`, which draws a suitable location for the new apple.

### Task 3.2: Make the snake grow when it eats an apple

Your task is to make the snake grow after it has eaten an apple.

To make things easier for you, we have extracted the logic for calculating the next snake as the function `getNextSnake(snake, direction, ?shouldGrow)`.
`shouldGrow` is an optional third argument, and is a boolean.

### Tutorial: Svelte component lifecycle, plus setInterval

In order to solve the upcoming task, you will have to be able to solve the following tasks from the Svelte tutorial:

- [Task about `onMount`](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/onmount)
- [Task about `onDestroy`](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/ondestroy) (which also touches upon `setInterval`)

### Task 3.3: Make the game tick

Your task is to make the snake move at regular time intervals instead of when the user presses an arrow key.
When the time to move has come, the snake should move in the direction that the user last pressed.
In the demo version of the game, the time interval is 100 ms, but you can change it if you wish.

### Task 3.4: Stop ticking when the snake dies

When the snake hits itself or a wall, it's _game over_.

Your task is to introduce _game over_ by stopping the game clock when one of the said things occur.
The game should stop as a _reaction_ to the snake moving, and not as a part of `moveSnake`.

To stop the ticking, we have extracted a function `stopTicking` that you might use.

#### Hint: Helper functions

You will find the helpful functions `isInsideBoard` and `isSnakeEatingItself` in `game-helpers.js`.

#### Hint: Reactivity

Remember reactivity and if-sentences, `$: if (x) { ‚Ä¶ }`, and how you can translate human-language game logic to such sentences almost verbatim.

If we were to state the rules for game over in spoken language, we would have said something like:

- ‚ÄúIf the snake head is outside the board or inside the snake itself, it's game over.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIf the game is over, the ticking stops.‚Äù

### Task 3.5: Only react to perpendicular key presses

Once you have gotten game over working, you might discover a problem: The snake dies if you press the arrow key that points in the opposite direction of where the snake is currently headed, because it ends up eating its own neck.
This can also happen if you try to take a U-turn.
In this and the next task, we will try to avoid this.

Your task is to make the snake react only to key presses that are perpendicular to the snake's current direction.
If the snake is going north, the game should only register key presses from the left and right arrow keys.
As with many other tasks, there is a function in `game-helpers.js` that can help you.

### Task 3.6: Use a queue to keep track of future movements

**This is a challenge task that has more to do with programming than Svelte itself.
You can skip to the next task if you want.**

In the solution to task 3.5 that you find in `tasks/3.5-end`, you can still make the snake eat itself if you are quick.
If the snake for example moves north and the player quickly presses ‚¨ÖÔ∏è followed by ‚¨áÔ∏è, the game ends up registering ‚¨áÔ∏è as the next direction.

We can avoid the problem by using a _queue_ to keep track of the directions that the snake is going to move in.
When the snake is going to move, we dequeue a direction and move the snake in that direction.
This makes it possible to input advanced movements quickly without worrying about timing.

We have created the variable `headDirectionQueue`, an array that keeps track of the directions the user has planned for the snake to move in.
Instead of changing `headDirection` when the user presses a key, you should append the direction the user entered to `headDirectionQueue`.
When it is time for the snake to move, the app should use the first perpendicular direction in the queue as the new value for `headDirection`.
In other words: Remove all non-perpendicular directions from the start of the queue until you find a perpendicular direction.
Use this element as the next `headDirection` and let the subsequent queue entries remain as they are.

Make the necessary changes in `moveSnake` and `handleKeydown`.

## Part 4: Animation

When you have finished this part, the game should have an animated snake, skull and apples.

### Tutorial: Control blocks

- [if-blocks](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/if-blocks)
- [else-blocks](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/else-blocks)
- [key-blocks](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/key-blocks)

### Tutorial: How transitions work

Svelte comes with the module `svelte/transition`.
This makes it possible to animate an element that enters or exits the document.

- [The transition-attribute](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/transition)
- [Adding parameters to transitions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/adding-parameters-to-transitions)
- [Different transitions for in and out](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/in-and-out)

### Task 4.1: Animate the apple

Your task is to make the new apple pop up in its place when the snake eats the old apple.

To make this work, you need to import the transition `scale` from `svelte/transition` and add it to the right element.
To limit the animation to when the apple pops up, you should use `in:` instead of `transition:`.
(You can also try [other transitions](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-transition).)

### Hint: Use a suitable block

Normally, Svelte only runs a transition animation if the HTML-element it is assigned to disappears from or enters the document.
You can tell Svelte to re-run the transition when some value changes using a key-block: `{#key <value>}<content>{/key}`.

### Task 4.2: Add a skull when the snake dies

In the style block, there is a class `skull`.
Your task is to make a `<div/>` with the class `skull` pop up when the snake dies.
It should have the same coordinates as the snake's head.

To animate the skull, add a `transition:scale` with a 300 ms delay.

### Task 4.3: Animate the snake's head

In the style block, there is a class `head`.
This styles and animates a snake head as long as you put it on an element with the class `body-part`.
Your task is to add an animated snake head using this class.

You do not need to use any `transition:‚Ä¶` here.
The styling takes care of the animation as long as you put the right class in the right place.

### Task 4.4: Animate the snake's tail

Your task is to animate the snake's tail.
There is a class, `tail`, that you can add to an element to get the same sliding animation as for the head, but without magnifying the body part.

Add an animated tail to the snake.

**Warning**: The tail may blink a little in all browsers except Firefox (including Chrome and Safari) due to a layout engine bug.
You can count the task as done when you have an animated tail that sometimes blinks.
The task solution contains a workaround for the blinking.
Unfortunately, we can not reveal what the workaround is, because that would reveal the solution to the main task.

## Part 5: Components

When you have finished this part, the game should have a game over screen with a high score list fetched from a server.
On the screen, you should be able to register your name and submit it to the server along with your latest score.

### Tutorial: Components

Do the following tasks from Svelte tutorial:

- [Nested components](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/nested-components)
- [Declaring props](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/declaring-props)

### Task 5.1: Create a component that appears when the game ends

The `GameOverModal.svelte` file is located in the same directory as `+page.svelte`.
Your task is to make the component appear on screen when the game is over and make it show the player's score.

It's a bit tricky to get the component to appear on screen in an elegant way.
We have therefore added some divs to the bottom of `+page.svelte`'s template section where you can mount the `<GameOver>` component.

### Task 5.2: Extract the board as a component

`+page.svelte` has become a bit overwhelming.
It handles two things at once: keeping track of the game _and_ displaying it.
We can make the file easier to read by letting another component display the game.

Your task is to create a file named `Board.svelte` within `src/routes/tasks/5.2/problem`.
Extract the code that is responsible for displaying the board, apple and snake in `+page.svelte` (from both the script, styling and template parts).
Decide on what data to copy and what to pass as properties.

Import and mount the new component in `+page.svelte`, replacing the code that was previously used to display the game.
Delete the unused parts of the style and script blocks.

#### If you mess up `+page.svelte`, use `git restore`

You can use the command `git restore` to reset `src/routes/tasks/5.2/problem/+page.svelte` to its original state.

Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root folder.
Paste the command `git restore src/routes/tasks/5.2/problem/+page.svelte` and press enter.
The file should now be as it was when you started the task.

#### Hint: Go up and out

This task will be unnecessarily hard if you start too deep into the HTML elements.
Start as high up and as far out as you possibly can.

#### Hint: How we solved this

**This hint will spoil almost everything.
Read it only if you are completely stuck.**

Start by copying `<div class="board" ‚Ä¶ >` and its enclosed contents.
Paste them into `Board.svelte`.
Copy the entire `<style>` block to `Board.svelte`.
Delete the `<div class="board" ‚Ä¶ >` from `+page.svelte`.

Your editor should immediately complain about what data and functions from `<script>` that is missing in `Board.svelte`.
The data or functions are is still used in `+page.svelte` will have to be passed to properties of `Board`.
Data and functions that are unused in `+page.svelte`, can be cut and paste it into the `<script>` part of `Board`.

Import `Board` to `+page.svelte` using `import Board from "./Board.svelte"`.
Mount the component where the `<div class="board" ‚Ä¶ >` was located.
Pass data to all the properties that you decided on.

Once you see that things work, look at the output from the terminal where you started `npm run dev`.
This output should tell you which parts of style are unused and in what file.
Delete the parts that the output tells you are unused within the files you have changed.

## Part 6: Network

Warning: This part is for people who have experience with network calls, promises and the like in Javascript.
If you think the tasks are too hard, you can skip to part 7.

### Tutorial: Await blocks

Javascript _promises_ are used for actions that could take time and possibly fail, often network requests.
Svelte has a special block to handle promises, called the await-block.

Solve [the task about await blocks from Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/await-blocks) before you proceed.

### Task 6.1: Fetch the high score list from the API

The SvelteKit process which runs during development contains a small in-memory database keeping track of a high score list that you can fetch and post your last score to.

The `fetchScores` function from `src/lib/api-helpers.js` fetches the high score list.
Your task is to import this function and display the high score list in the `<GameOver>` component you made.

If you want to stick to the same visual theme as in the rest of the game, you can check the [documentation for the Nes.CSS theme](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) (or the task solution).

Warning: When working with promises, functions defined with the `function` keyword may behave strangely.
To avoid bugs, use arrow functions instead (`const foo = () => {‚Ä¶}`).

### Tutorial: Binding variables to input fields

Solve [the task about text inputs and binding](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/text-inputs) before you proceed.

### Task 6.2: Add name input field

Your task is to create a field where people can fill in their name and score.
Also create a button that people can click on to submit their name and score in the format `{ name: string, score: number }`.
You can use the `postScore` function from `api-helpers.js` to do this.

When the score has been submitted, the component should fetch the updated high score list.

Note: Because the database is not in permanent memory, any data you add to it will be lost when you restart the development server.
If you cause the database to break by submitting invalid data, you can restart the development server to get a blank slate.

## Part 7: Game Over?

Congratulations! **You were very smart to read through the tasks before starting!** Or maybe you actually did all the tasks? Wooooaaahh!!!!!1

Part 7 is a sandbox where you can do almost anything you want to.

### Task 7.1: Deploy your game to Vercel

Projects written in SvelteKit can be deployed to different web services.
The easiest way to deploy your game is to the online service Vercel.

#### Deploying to Vercel

Deploying a Svelte app to Vercel is as simple as typing `npx vercel` into your terminal.
If you have not already signed up for or logged into Vercel, the tool will help you do that.

Give the default answer to all questions.
After a minute or two, Vercel will have deployed the app for you.
Its final output should be the URL where you can find your app.

If you want to update your app, run `npx vercel` again.

#### Other services that you can deploy to

Under the hood, SvelteKit compiles a web app in two steps:
It first compiles the app into an intermediary format, found in the folder `.svelte-kit`.
This output is then run through an adapter which converts this output to the environment that you want to deploy to.
This may be some other hosting service, like Cloudflage Pages or Netlify.
You can also deploy the app to a server that you control yourself.

[The <q>Adapters</q> section in the SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) lists a number of officially supported adapters.
If you want to run your own server, the `node` or `static` adapters will probably be the way to go.
The documentation also points you in the direction of community-provided adapters that you can use if none of the officially supported adapters suit your needs.

### Task 7.2: Improve the game

There are still some possible improvements to the game:

#### Tasks without solutions in the `finished-game` folder

We have not tried making the following things ourselves (yet), but we think they are both solvable ‚Äì and fun:

- **Edge holes**: Holes on the board edges that the snake can use to teleport to an equivalent hole on the other side of the board, like Pacman.
- **Obstacles**: Some areas in the middle of the board are unreachable ‚Äì call them walls, islands or whatever.
  They are as the edge of the board: The snake dies when it enters such an area.
- **Golden apples**: Make golden apples appear from time to time in addition to the regular apple.
  5 points are awarded if you eat them within a certain time.
- **Sound effects**: Add sounds when the snake eats the apple, when it dies and such.
  Remember to use headphones if you share your work area with other people.

If you feel like you are not ready to work without a solution yet, you can try a task for which a solution exists in the folder `src/routes/finished-game`.

#### Tasks with solutions in the `finished-game` folder

The game in the folder `src/routes/finished-game` has some functions that have not been turned into explicit tasks:

- Pause
- Start screen
- Restart button on the game over screen

Try to make these functions without looking at the code in `src/routes/finished-game`.
You can use the solution to the last task as a starting point.

### Task 7.3: Other games

Maybe you can make one of the following games:

- [Whac-a-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) ‚Äì [we have already tried](https://mos.knowit.no/)
- [Breakout](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)>)

### Task 7.4: After this course

If you think Svelte is fun and want to learn more, we have the following recommendations:

- Finish [the Svelte tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/)
  - Check [the documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs) afterwards.
    You know almost all there is to know there after the tutorial.
- Try [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), Svelte's equivalent to Next.js and Nuxt.js.
  - Your first project could be a game collection website.
    Publish it and wait for ‚Äúflash games‚Äù to make a comeback.

### Final words

All that remains to say is that we hope you have enjoyed our workshop.
Game over!
